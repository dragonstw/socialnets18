### Course Description & Goals
This course will use social network analysis; both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.

Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

The course structure is based on the [techied](http://bit.ly/techied) framework.

### Textbook & Tools
* Required: D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. [Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book). Cambridge University Press, 2010. 
    - The whole book is avilable online.
    - Referred to in the schedule below as E&K
* [Gephi](http://gephi.org/) is a tool for visualizing and manipulating graphs that we will use in our assignments.
* [NetLogo](http://www.ladamic.com/netlearn) is a tool that can be used for modeling & simulating networks.

## Communications
* You should sign up for the [**AAIT ITSC Slack group**](https://aaititsc.slack.com/) (I'll send an invite) for communication with the professor and with other students.
* Furthermore, this syllabus and all other class documentation and assignments will be available on the [**socialnets18**](https://github.com/dragonstw/socialnets18) git repository.


## Course Policies
### Course Grade
* 50% Lab Activities 
* 20% Midterm Exam
* 20% Final exam
* 10% Participation (attendance, interaction in class, knowledge quizzes)

Letter grades are given at 5-point intervals:
* A+       90-100
* A        83-90
* A-       80-83
* B+       75-80
* B        68-80
* B-       65-68
* C+       60-65
* C        50-60
* C-       45-50
* D	   40-45
* Fx	   30-40
* F	   0-30

A grading rubric will be posted along with each assignment (Lab Activity), explicitly calling out several areas your assignment should address.  An effort is made for this grading to be balanced, gauging your effort, learning, and of course, competency.

### Attendance & Participation
Physical attendance at lectures & labs is expected.  However, you can miss 2 days for any reason with no consequence to your participation grade.  Please discuss any extenuating circumstances with the instructor.
 
    Missed classes:   _______________________     __________________________
 
During lectures & labs, we will learn through groups and a variety of active learning techniques.  Participation in these activities is part of your grade (part of the 10%).



### Late Work
You can submit a Lab Activity after the deadline and receive 75% of the credit.

You are encouraged to contact the instructor if there is an extenuating circumstance and you know the work may be late.  
 
 
### Group Work, Attribution, Plagiarism, and Academic Honesty
Group work and learning from peers on the homework assignments is encouraged.  Frequently, you will find that you accelerate your learning when you learn from peers, and you internalize concepts when you teach them to peers.  Helping your peers should be done in the private `socialnets18` Slack channel, so that we can give you credit for helping each other out.

How does this work with academic honesty and plagiarism?  On any graded assignment: every sentence or equation you write, every line of code that you turn in, you must understand and produce yourself â€” no cut and paste.  Thus, when doing group work, you should not use anything directly from the meeting, e.g., notes, scrollback in an interactive Python session, cut-and-pasting a chat session.  Everything (code and explanations) should be internalized and re-typed/produced for the actual assignment.

If you are essentially using someone else's idea (even having internalized and retyped/rewritten it), you must give attribution to the source (where it came from) and fully/explicitly describe it in words.

If you utilize others' work without understanding it or without attribution, this will constitute *plagiarism* and you will immediately receive an **Fx** grade for the course.  You may also be censured by the university, with potential ramifications such as suspension or dismissal from your program.

Course participants are expected to maintain academic honesty in their course work. Participants should refrain from seeking past published solutions to any assignments. Literature and resources (including Internet resources) employed in fulfilling assignments must be cited, or they will be considered plagiarism as well.
