Assignment 4

## Introduction
our last assignment deals with networks over time. In this semister, "social net" class have
helped us to know new terms and differnt tools and algorithms that are used in Network. 
While doing this assinment we will encounter Networks that will evolve over time.


## Methods
 we have three  diifernt toos to do this assignment. One is using Snappy, 
second using pandas, lastley using Gephi.I  have tried to see the other tools,
 because i find it time taking i used gephi and execl (by uding excel we can
calculate  the stanared deviation and mean results) as the pervious assignments 
because i am familar with it.

## Results

The results are as follows;
Number of Weakly Connected Components: 1
Number of Strongly Connected Components: 185
Diameter: 7
Modularity: 0.661
Number of Communities: 15

clustering coefficient for community 0=0.112, community 1=0.564, community 2=0.831, community 3=0.631, community 4=0.559, community 5=0.252, community 6=0.614, community 7=0.416, community 8=0.712, community 9=0.311, community 10=0.542, community 11=0.572, community 12=0.186, community 13=0.813

- 20 weeks; the number of components is 241 and the average path length 2.798.

- 30 weeks; the number of components is 236 and the average path length 2.781.

- 40 weeks; the number of components is 217 and the average path length 2.750.

## Disscussion
There is a main question we should try to answer in this lab, 
before answering the question we must clearly know what a bridge is.
 In interperting the question i have reached into a conclusion that 
bridge people are more effiecient because when number of components gets low which in other woed means "bridges'are more and APL(avarage path length)gets low so that distance get shorter therfeore  inforamtion can go easily(effieciently).


## Conclusion
in this assignment we have gained a new knowlege about networks over time.i have seen the term 'bridge'
 in a more detail way, i have a good understang about temporal network .finally  i would like to thank you 
for the amazing time we had in the classroom. God bless you!
