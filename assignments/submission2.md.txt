### Assignment 2: Detecting Communites

Bethelhem Hailegebreil



####Introduction
The following write-up concludes on the results and steps on how I Detected the Communities using different social networks. The Email-EU-core network and the YouTube social network which I got from the assignment given to us on GitHub. 

#### Part 1: Email-EU-core network

###Method
As me being familiar with Gephi in the previous assignments, it’s the tool I used to partition the graphs on the assignment given on how to detect communities. The tool uses the Louvain algorithm to partition the graph and extract the communities from the network given to us.This algorithm optimizes possibly the best portioning of the nodes in the network. By the time the algorithm is done performing its job, different communities got to get differentiated by colors and how well they are connected to eachother.

#### Results
From the results seen by running the modularity after differentiating the communities is as follows
Node: 1005
Edges: 25571
Average Degree = 25.444
Average Weighted Degree = 25.444
Network Diameter = 7
Modularity = 0.415
Average Clustering Coefficient = 0.372
Average Path Length = 2.653
  
The nodes that overlap between the two communities is the average clustering coefficient which is 0.372

##### Discussion 
Most part of the ground-truth-communities don’t differ for the algorithm-communities applied by the modularity a number of 26 as seen in the data laboratory section. The algorithm-communities depends on how well they are connected than the ground-truth-communities to detect the communities as it is the whole point of the assignment.

### Part 2: YouTube Social Network

#### Remark
This section would have been about differentiating communites on a Social network file given to us of YouTube but unfortunately, the file is too big as Gephi being the tool I used. I was not able to do this part.
