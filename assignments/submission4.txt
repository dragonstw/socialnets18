# Assignment 4: Networks over time
Nathan Tibebe


## Introduction
Networks over time are networks that have different birth order and they are also creating new links.Examples can be information cascade and viral video.

## Methods

In this process I used gephi tool for visualization. When i used gephi to open the data I placed three headers on the spreadsheet.
Source Target and time then open the file in gephi.
To take 3 snapshots of the network I used filters for interval. The filters are located in toolbar menu > windows > filters then in filters attribute > range > time.
To run the layout I use force atlas 2 and apply the default appearance.

## Results

Diameter 7

Clustering coefficient 0.352

Average path length 2.653

Average degree 25.83

Graph density 0.026

## Discussion

Q. A "bridge" person in an organization which connects many different people. Are "bridge" people more efficient or less efficient at email communication?

Answer. From my review I can see that when more days come the weakly connected components are increasing more rapidly than the strongly connected components.

The network diameter, average path length or average degree did not change so much. So my conclusion is similar as other students also said. 
From this network we learn that email communication has more bridge people. So bridge people are more efficient for email.

## Conclusion

I took more days to complete this assignments because I refered to different materials to come up with a conclusion. Now my knowledge about network over time has increased greatly.
At last I want to give my appreciation to my classmates like Geleta for explaining the concept of bridge people and filter usage on gephi.
