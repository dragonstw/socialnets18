                                               INTRODUCTION
In my point of view, we did this lab in order to see our social network structure analysis
 in the form of graph.as a result, we can understand more about metrics defined in our lecture. 

                                                  METHODS
first, i added the google chrome extension called "LostCircle" to my browser. and then logged in to
my facebook account. then i start loading the data. after many trials, the data loaded 100% but i can not 
downloaad it even on other computers. so i told the problem i face to the teacher and he told me to do the  
the assignment with his own data.he gave me the graphml file with flash drive and i downloaded Gephi 0.9.2.
then i refr to the gephi tutorial and other  youtube videos to understand about gephi and to know how it works.
To answer the questions mentioned in the assignment1, i read the slides which we have learned and watch youtube 
videos related to that.

1. Average path length
2. Node Degree
3. Average Degree
4. connectance
5.clustering coefficient

                                                      DISCUUSSION

Average path length:-The (overall) clustering coefficient of a node v is
the probability that u1, u2 (two randomly selected neighbors of v) are themselves neighbors.

Node Degree:- The node degree is the number of neighbors a node has.

Average Node  Degree:- is the average shortest path length (average distance).
