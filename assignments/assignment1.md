## Introduction
This lab help to understand the connection or link between my Facebook friends in order to know more about the graph theory like node degree, average node degree, characteristic (average) path length, clustering coefficient, connectance etc. The graph also shows the mapping between our Facebook friends' friends with us.

## Methods
1. I use Lost Circles to populate my Facebook friends and also their friends and save the populated data as a Graphml file.
2. Import the saved Grphml file into Gephi.
3. On Gephi I did Visualization, Ranking, Different types of metrics, Layouts, Prtitioning and filtering the graph datas.
4. Export the file as svg file.

## Results
1. Connectance = 0.05347938...
2. Node Degree = 60
3. Average Node Degree = 5.134
4. Clustering Cofficient = 0.444
5. Characteristic (average) path length = 2.979

## Discussion
1. Connectance descibes what percent of my Facebook friends are connected (through any number of links) to most of my other Facebook friends
2. Node Degree shows the person with most Facebook friends in common with me.
3. Average Node Degree shows the average of how many Facebook friends do my friends have.
4. Clustering Cofficient shows how well-connected my Facebook friends are to each other.
5. Characteristic (average) path length shows the average of how close/far my Facebook friends are.
