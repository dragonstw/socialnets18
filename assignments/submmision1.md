# Introduction
This lab report is an exploration of the use of social network analysis (SNA) as a tool to calculate different metrics that help users of any social websites to know about the nodes(people) they are communicating using graphical  representation of friends with whom they have friendship like in Facebook using graphical tool called gephi. In this lab I will use my Facebook address to calculate the metrics. Social network analysis (SNA) holds promise as a diagnostic tool for collecting and analyzing relevant data with respect to patterns of relationships among individuals involved in a given network for this lab case my Facebook account. Network visualization is an important component in the analytical process. The “graph” generated through SNA software (gephi) is the symbolic representation of a network. SNA software generates a number of measures to illustrate quantitatively the nature of a given network that may be otherwise unobservable in the real social setting. Moreover we provide graph visualization and study several graph metrics with the help of Gephi We provide metrics and analyze network graph properties such as degree, average degree, Connectance measures, average coefficient clustering and connected components. From my extracted anonymized data I choose to further analyze users’ likes in conjunction with their relationships and provide basic statistics and analysis.

 
# Method
Before I go to my calculation I represent my Facebook account in graphs using the grape representation software called gephi. In grape nodes represent users, edges represent connections between them.
In this lab the aim is to analyze further the collected data of my Facebook using Gephi. For my Graph Analysis purposes I use this tool (Gephi) for visualizing and analyzing the data I collected from my Facebook account using lost circle. Gephi’s fast graph visualization engine enables users to understand and discover patterns in large graphs, while the platform can handle networks up to 50K nodes and 500K edges can iterate through visualization using dynamic filtering and provide rich tools for meaningful graph manipulation. So with the help of Gephi I will analyze my Facebook account data (friends relationship) using the gephi Graph analysis.
For my Graph I will provide drawings and measure properties of the graph
                Such as      
*	Connected components
*	Degree
*	Average degree
*	Connectance
*	Average cluster coefficient 
I import my graph that consists of 2489 edges and 143 nodes. So calculating the metrics of statics to get result using gephi calculation method which use provided formula to get intended output of metrics.  


# Result 
The experimental results follow. Metrics previously presented in the analysis of data are part of the methodology defined.
 The following measures have been investigated.
*	Degree
*	Average degree
*	Connectance
*	Average cluster coefficient 
*	Connected components




# Discussion
In this lab I made Facebook social network analysis to find out different metrics involved in this lab to study the relationship with friend and between themselves by visualizing for understanding the social network phenomena. In Formal social network concepts are aggregations of underlying network data, which makes them difficult for users to interpret without explicit visual support .This is particularly true in the case of large data sets. However, tin this I used network visualization techniques provide limited support to analysts working to understand these metrics involved in lab assignment. Without additional support, analysts must cognitively infer network concepts from their data sets or synthesize information obtained from multiple views of the same network, which is challenging and error prone. In order to provide greater levels of support, I used here a concept visualization approach that
Explicitly presents the network concepts of degree, Connectance, average degree, average clustering coefficient, and connected components. In this report I have described a network visualization system using grape representation tool called gephi that I used to demonstrate the concept visualization approach to get all the metrics that are needed in this lab session.
