Introduction
This is lab two documentation of detecting community in the given network using different available algorithm to detect community in network and I did a comparison between community detection and ground-truth community detection.

Method
Before I begin to detect community in the network I represent network data in graphs using   software called gephi. In this graph nodes represent users, edges represent connections among them.
In this lab the purpose is to analyze and detect community from network data using Gephi. As I mention I use this tool (Gephi) for community detection using detection algorithm. The algorithm I use here is Louvain (modularity) and ground-truth (using department id). To do that I first I changed text file to excel (csv) file and then I imported to the Gephi do the algorithm to detect the community. The reason why I choose this algorithm (modularity) is because it gives me more clear communities in the network.

Result 
The detection result is as follow. Community detection and ground-truth.
 The followings are collected community detection.
  Using modularity (Louvain) number of community detected are 27 (0.414).
Using number of community detected ground-truth (department) are 52(0.9).

Discussion
This lab is community detection using preferred algorithm that are available for detecting community in a given network. Here I have EU email data for detection using community detection and ground-truth communities. Using the algorithm I could detect the community in the in network. But there was a little difference in community distribution of both in community detection and ground-truth communities algorithm that means more community detected and it is  to some extent what I expected.   

FOR THE SECOND PART I HAVE NOT FINISHED YET because it is very large data and complex for it undirected graph.
