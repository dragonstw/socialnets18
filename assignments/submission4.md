# Assignment 4: Networks over time
## sophonias Bekele


## Introduction

This Temporal Network Assignment help me see it's data from a new angle and analysis it better than ever because it's data is given in the timeline fashion where node1,node 2 is node in the network  Time is timestamp(temporal Edges) of each Edges and in data anlysis can also compute dynamic data trough given time line and it represents real life dataset which also help me see its Application in the actual world networks.


## Methods
	I have used gephi network analysis tool and Excel like mentioned in option 3.

	step 1: convert the dataset to approprate gephi data.
	step 2: use gephi to change (Src,Dist,time) time data to time intervals and Enable timeline option.
	step 3: use gephi to compute cluster coeffient, conneted components, modularity,...etc.
	step 4: use Excel to calculate cluster coeffient ,Mean and Standard Deviation. 
			->I have calculated cluster coeffient to each communities in the dataset.
	step 5: use gephi to screenshot the graph in 12,096,000 (20 weeks),18,144,000 (30 weeks)
	and 24,192,000 (40 weeks).

## Discussion
Bridge person is less efficient at email communication because once they know the node they want to communicate to they can commnicate independently of that bride person. and also if we see connected Components for the whole timeline weakly connected component is 1 this shows as through time node become more connected and does not need much of bride person.



## Conclusion
Finally Temporal network is used to know how Edges are created through time and which node is connected to which in specfic time
