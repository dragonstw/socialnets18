# Assignment 4 : Networks over time
Alula Tsegaye

## Introduction
For this assignment I used Gephi to visualize and measure some important metrics asscociated with the different graphs. Also i tried to run community detection algorithm on the department graphs.

### Methods
I used the gephi documentation pdf and follow some basic visualization methods and different layouts.  

### Results
i made ranking based on connection id for all communities.
I used the force atlas layout as i used for ground truth communities in assignment 2 since its principle is easy as linked nodes
attract each other and non-linked nodes are repelling eachother.
community 1 is the biggest with 98.1% where as other communities outside the top 11
 (101 communities) are 0.0011% and as a result are set with the same color.
Clustering coefficient = 0.01
Average path length = 6.2
standard deviation of time each graph is formed = 0.5
mean deviation of time each graph is formed = 0.003

### Discussion
The bridge people are less efficient because in a way they are structured loosely linking one department to another they are closely tied and connected strongly in the other departments which maked difficult in them being made close aliaces for different community deopartments. 

### Conclusion
To summerize i have learned from this assignment that as the more time goes networks tend to share some common ground in rapid rise and become constant after the first contact and bridges will be the in all these.
