###What does the code do?
Firstly th code has three functions namely, tuple_list_to_string, print_version_info, name_vs_brown.

The code accepts full name and change all characters to lower case and remove spaces in the name string. It also prints the frequency of a particular string.
Then it prints some unigrams, finally it prints the Python and nltk versions we use.

All the above functions run in the order provided on the main function of the code.
