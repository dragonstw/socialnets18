# Introduction
### This lab is particularly designed for analyzing a facebook network connectivity with freinds and their mutual friends to know the graph concept and how well connected they are and all other graph theories. we are doing this exercise to gt a good knowledge on the ideas of how graphs are working and do some calculation on their respective technical terminologies.
# Methods
#### The methods where simple so far, but the internet connection was slow and make it difficult to download my facebook data using lostcircle and some of the questions asked where a bit tricky to get the concept and calculate the numbers required.
# Result
The result i saw was interested that i dont really know how well i was connected with my friends and how well they were connected to each other, i also see whom of my friends are well connected to others of my freinds. The concept is so far great and as we get deeper it might be very interested. My gephi result is attached to this text in a picture format to highlight my frends connectivity.

# Discussion
 i use the node degree to find the most freind in common with me who also share many of my friends. i use average node degree to know how many freinds do my friends have. using clustering coefficient i know how close or far my freinds are. edge weight can tell me how well my freinds are connected eachother.
