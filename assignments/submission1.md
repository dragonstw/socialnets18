# introduction
- We are doing this lab to analyse the statistics of our facebook account and see what our friends have.We will be using some methods we learnd in class to calculate and give our answers.
 
# methods

- For the questions I used connectance to calculate the first question, degree to calculate the second uestion, average degree for the third, cluster coefficient for the fourth and , path distance for the fivth question. 

# result

- The results were 0.032 for the first, my friend beantamlack feleke (203) for the second, 29.6 for the third question, 0.37 for the fourth question, and 3.22 for the fivth question. As the resut shows I have a lot of friends but most of them are not connected to eachother and you can clearly see one giant component form the picture. This was a fun project because I really enjoyed visiualizing all my facebook friends form a new perspective.
- I found it really hard when I downloaded my facebook data. The file was too large.

# discussion

- The node degree represents my friends and the edges their connection. Counting the node will give me all my friends number and finding someone with the maximum node gives most common friend. clustering coeficinet tells me how close my friends are. And lastly the average degree tells me how much frends my friends have.
