# Introduction
- In doing this assignment or lab we will see our own facebook account statistics as a graph. And all our  friends that we dont know in a better way. For the question provided we will be using some algothims to find exact answers.

# Methods
- I used node value to calculate the number of friend i have,cluster cofficient to find how close or far my friends are,to calculate  how many Facebook friends my  friends have i use avarage node degree, and to find the most friend that i have in common i used degree value,to find what percent of my friends are are connected i used this formula: edges * 2/ nodes then take the outcome of that and divided it by node -1

# Results
- The first one is 0.02581 which is the percent of my friends that are connected,the second one is to find the a friend that has the most common friends with me which is 439 and th name is FLW,the third question is about on avarge  how many friends my friends have, the value is 25.84, the forth one how well connected my friends are and the answer is 0.556,the last question is about  how close or far are my friends  since i have not much friends and my answer show a small number and close to one so they are more connected each other. This assignment was very fun and it was my first experince doing this stuff, in my graph they are grouped in a differnt colored compenent wich is very cool and to see all my friends in such a simple graph was amazing.But downloading my facebook data was very time taking and annoying ,thanks to u i have finished it with the data u gave me..
