Mintesnot Melesse


## Introduction
This lab helped me to understand the connection  between Facebook friends and I did this lab to know more about the graph theory and it's statistics. It also understand  the mapping between my Facebook friends and their friends.

### Methods
I got the graphml file of a Facebook data from Dr.Stephen as Facebook company blocked the service of populating Facebook friends data after the scandal with Cambridge Analytica.

I used Gephi to calculate statistics and many other graph metrics.

### Results
Connected/Giant Component : 38

Node Degree : 439

Average Node Degree : 25.844

Clustering Cofficient : 0.556

Characteristic (average) path length : 2.93

### Discussion
Giant component descibes what percent of the sample data's Facebook friends are connected to most of it's other Facebook friends. Node Degree shows the person with most Facebook friends in common with the sample Facebook data Dr.Stephen gave me. Average Node Degree shows on average how many Facebook friends do the friends of the sample data have. Clustering Cofficient shows how well-connected the sample data's Facebook friends are to each other. Characteristic (average) path length shows the average of how close or far the sample data's Facebook friends are.
