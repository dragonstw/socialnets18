## Introduction

This assignmrnt helped us to understand the inner workings of network analysis.

It also helped us to understand the connections between my facebook friends and also how we are interconnected with our facebook which allows me to grasp the concept of the graph theory.

## Methods

First I attempted to use lost circles to download my Facebook data but I couldn't get it to work which is when I was provided a facebook data in GraphML format by my teacher.

Then I installed gephi and started to work on the facebook data.

I customized the colors, filtered the graph and calcualte the statistics.

## Results

Average Degree = 25.844

Average Weighted Degree = 47.126

Network Diameter = 10

Graph Density = 0.026

Modularity = 0.733

Connected Components = 38

Average Clustering Coefficient = 38

Average Path Length = 2.93

## Discussion
Connectance - is standardized as the ratio of the number of edges to the maximum number of edges possible.

Node degree - used to find the person with most friends in common with me.

Average node degree - is the average of all the available node degree

Clustering cofficient -  is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.

Characterstic path length - is defined as the median of the means of the shortest path lengths connecting each vertex to all other vertices.
