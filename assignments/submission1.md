# Introduction
This assignment able us to see our own facebook account statistics in a graph format. and also our facebook friends that we dont know often see. i answers some question asked using some calculations on graph theory.

# Methods
 The methods are different for each questions, like for example to calculate the number of friend i have i used node value, and i use cluster cofficient to find how close or far my friends are,how many Facebook friends my friends can be calculated using  avarage node degree, and i know  the most friend that i have in common by using degree value,to get the percent of my friends how they are connected i calculate edges * 2 divides nodes then divide the result by node - 1 

# Results
 0.025 is the percent of my freinds, the most common friend that i also have has 439 and FLW is the name, 25.8 is the average of how many mutual friends my friends also have,  how well connected my friends are is 0.56, as i see my freinds in the data and tells me how close or far are my friends the result tells me all of my friends are connected to each other well. The idea of this assignment is new for me so it might help me to gain such an experience for the future in how social data can be analyzed. The tool(gephi) is fun to work because it have so many options to grouped,designed and analyze the given data. The hardest part i faced was submitted on the due because the work was a bit large and needs time.
