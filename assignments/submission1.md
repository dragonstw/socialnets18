## Introduction

This lab deals with metrics about a social network graph. Gephi helps to extract the data from the data and calculate the node degree and other informations.

## Methods

First I downloaded the prepared graphml format for the facebook data and opened it using Gephi. Then analyze it by assigning force atlas layout to the graph. 

The percentage of connected friends is defined by connectance.
The person with most common friends with me is similar to my node degree. But average node degree is the average of that. meaning, how many friends they have on average. 

Between 0 and 1, a clustering coefficient defines how connected my friends are to each other.

## Discussion

Average Degree 25.844
Average Clustering Coefficient = 0.556
Diameter 10
Average Path Length 2.92950025
Weakly connected 38
