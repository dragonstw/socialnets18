# introduction
- This lab is all about analysing the statistics of our facebook account and see what our friends have. For this Assignement we Use Our Facebook account and it was very awsome to see all my friends and what we can do with gephy like gernerate our facebook Statsics and others. in doing this assingment we know more on how we can calculate all the statics we learned in class.
 
# methods

- The method I use to calclulate the 1st quetion is 'CONNECTANCE'. here is the forumula which i use:
	{[(edge*2)/Node]/Node-1} = 0.090
	there fore for the first answer I get 0.090. So 0.090 is how all my friends are connected.	

- For the 2nd Quetion I used Node Degree to find which facebook friend have most number of connection. The friend who have more number of connection is Michael Moges 256
- For the 3rd Quetion the avarage degree is 64.199.
- The 4th Quetion show how well are each node connected to others. The calculated clustering Coefficient is 0.45.
- For the 5th Quetion I used The 'average path length' which shows the number of steps between nodes. Therfor the answer is 2.57. And Also I am not the shortest link b/c Clustering Coefficient is closer to zero.
