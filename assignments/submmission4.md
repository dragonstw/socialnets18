INTRODUCTION




This lab is the fourth of our lab assignment in social networking focusing on how important the local bridge(bridge person in our case)
in  the email communication of the institutions also it is concerned with other attribute 
that help us finding out how this local bridge(bridge person in our case) significant in the the email network.
  
  
  
 
 
METHOD
 
 
 
 
There are different method that I used to figure how important or vital is the local bridge(bridge person in our case) in the network connecting 
the institution in the network community.among those method which I used are clustering coefficient,modularity,
time interval,strongly connected component and average length path and 
depending on their out put which I put on result section, I could make conclusion weather this bridge person are important or not in network connecting these communities .
 



 
RESULT



mean-209.005


standard deviation-40756.87


diameter -7


average path length-2.65


average-degree-25.28


average clustering coefficient-0.352


number of community -15


modularity-0.662


I used inter edge modularity class to calculate clustering coefficient of each community 


average clustering coefficient  of each individual communities in the network are as follow


community 0-0.035


community 1-0.042


community 2-0.026


community 3-0.0


community 4-0.007


community 5-0.023


community 6-0.001


community 7-0.056


community 8-0.057


community 9-0.020


community 10-0.024


community 11-0.089


community 12-.0.044


community 13-0.019


community 14-0.029
 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION




In this part of I am giving answer whether the bridge person is important or not 
using the out put of different network statistics like clustering coefficient,average path length since time stamp vary 
both attribute including other in the network statistics changes.as the time  stamp increase clustering coefficient decrease while average path length increase.
depending on the out put finally I figured out that the bridge person in the network of email 
helped in connecting the different institution in the the network(this show that bridge person is important in connecting the institution of this email users) 
but it is not as much as it intended to connect them. 




CONCLUSSION
 
 

In assignment what I noticed is that the how vital or paramount important is the local bridge(bridge person in our case) that connecting more than one group of connected component(the community in the network) to each and how important it is this (bridge person in our case) help in connecting different connected
components in the network of this different institution.
