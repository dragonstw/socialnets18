# Assignment 2: Detecting Communities
Feysel Meftuh


## Introduction
For assignmet two we must use community detection to analyse the data and e-mail form the European research institute. I will use gephi to see and study the emails being sent and recieved. I will try and answer all the questions.
## Part 1: Email-EU-core network
### Methods
To use gephi i had to use the user manual and see the different features wiht in the software. I first downloaded the data from the link provided then i extracted it and changed it to .csv format so gephi can read the file. After loading the file i used different tools like layout adjustment to change apperance and comunity detection tools to find the different comunities.
### Results
The number of comunities from the comunity detection algorithm is Number of Communities: 27. The number of comunities from the departement is 42 because there are 42 departements.
- The diameter is 7
- Number of components is 203

### Discussion
The difference between the ground-truth comunity and the comunity found from the comunity detecting algorithm is clear. There are different number of comunities and a different pattern. The data from the EU institution was partitioned using the Modularity comunity detection. The value of the diameter being seven tells us there is a seven hop(distance) gap between two nodes.
