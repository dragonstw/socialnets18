# Assignment 2: Detecting Communities
Mintesnot Melesse


## Introduction
While I was finding out and describing the methods, results and discussion, I was able to understand how directed graph works and differences between algorithm-communities and ground-truth-communities.

## Part 1: Email-EU-core network
### Methods
To produce the graph I used Gephi and I applied ranking of nodes with Modularity class atribute and I ran the Force Atlas 2 layouting algorithm with a scaling of 2.0 to get the graph shown below in the ```results``` section.
### Results
I got this graph after applying partitioning with Modularity and running Force Atlas 2 algorithm.

### Discussion
I found community detection is crucial in getting information from datas like the above one.
Algorithm-communities and ground-truth-communities show different aspects of the network.Here are the results, average degree = 25.444, Average weighted degree = 25.444, natwork diamater = 7, graph density = 0.025, modularity = 0.416, connected components = 20, average clustering coefficient = 0.372, average path length = 2.653.

## Part 2: YouTube social network
This part was too big and complex to be done with my competitional resources.But I hope I will do it in the future.

## Conclusion
It's sad that I couldn't get the chance to work on the YouTube social network due to the shortage of competitonal resources but I understood a lot about directed graph and algorithm-communities and ground-truth-communities while doing the Email-EU-core network.
