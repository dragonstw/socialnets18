# Assignment 2: Detecting Communities
Biruk Gebrekidan


## Introduction
This lab helps to demonstrate community detection. Community detection is a method of using various tools to detect data from social networks such as email and youtube. 

## Part 1: Email-EU-core network
### Methods
First I used gephi to arrange the graphs for community detection by importing the graph from excel file. Gephi has many algorithm and one of the algorithm I used helps for calculating modularity. 

### Results
The statistics shows the following data for community distribution:
Average degree 12.7
Modularity: 0.416
Average weighted degree = 25.4
Modularity with resolution= 0.416
Clustering coefficient = 0.18
There are 26 communities total.
Additionally, all of the edges are directed graphs because it is used to show communications.

### Discussion
Ground truth is a better way to determine community distribution because it shows all the percentages for department. Directed graph is used here because it is the only way to show who messages and send email to who and also who replies.
