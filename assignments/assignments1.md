Introduction

As we are learning about different social networks, I believe it is better to learn the lessons with the help of real practices. So, Basically we did this lab in order to analize Graphs. The main point of this lab is teaching us to visualize our own facebook data in a graph and in a more detalied data tables on Gephi. This will inturn help us to calculate and analyze the metrics of our data.

Methods

To get started from the start i downloaded and added lost circles which is a chrome extension and then downloaded my facebook data which was a tricky and time consuming step but i was able to download all my facebook data successfully. After finishing this i opened my .graphml file using Gephi and i was able to visualize my data in graph. Then i maniupulated and renderd the graph by referring to the gephi tutorial.

When i get into the actual process of producing the results of the metrics i referred to the lectures we have learned to summarize the metrics and basically i used the data labeled in Gephi. I produced the node degree from the Data Table  in Gephi to identify the person with most friends in common with me. I got the Average node degree from the statistics list in Gephi by running the Average Degree to calculate the number of facebook friends that my friends have on average. I used the connectance formula in the lectures to identify the how connected are my friends to eachother. Again i used the statistics list to run Average clustering Cofficient that showed me how close/far two random friends are in the network.
