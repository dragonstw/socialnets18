Introduction
-------------

As we are learning about different social networks, I believe it is better to learn the lessons with the help of real practices. So, Basically we did this lab in order to analize Graphs. The main point of this lab is teaching us to visualize our own facebook data in a graph and in a more detalied data tables on Gephi. This will inturn help us to calculate and analyze the metrics of our data.

Methods
--------

To get started from the start i downloaded and added lost circles which is a chrome extension and also an easy step and then i downloaded my facebook data which was a tricky and time consuming step but finally i was able to download all of my facebook data successfully. After finishing those steps i opened my .graphml file using Gephi that i have already downloaded and installed on my pc so, by using this Gephi tool i was able to visualize my data in a graph. Then i maniupulated and renderd the graph by referring to the gephi tutorial. In order to get the results of the metrics i referred to the lectures we have learned and basically i used the data table in the data laboratory to get a labeled data and referred to the statistics to get more of the results of the metrics.

I produced the node degree from the Data Table  in Gephi it identifies the person with most friends in common with me and that is lily alemu with a degree of 179. The Average node degree as calculated from the statistics in Gephi determines the number of facebook friends that my friends have on average. On Modularity, it basically is a community detection algorithm i used it to partition node in a community with color using modularity class. On Average Clustering Coffecient, it indicated how nodes are embedded in their neighborhood and how well connected are my friends. Average path length helped me to identify how close/far random pairs of friends are in the network, it also measured the Betweeness Centrality,Closeness Centrality and Eccentricity of the network. The last one is connectance, it made me realize what percent of my friends are connected to most of my other friends. I used the formula in the lectures to calculate the connectance.

The reason i choose to present my network in the above way is that it is easy to visualize all nodes and how their connection looks like and i also presented that way because it will make it easy to identify communities and their place.
